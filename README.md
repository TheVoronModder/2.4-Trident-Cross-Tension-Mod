## What is this wild mod pack?

Itâ€™s pretty straightforward. AWD systems have their belts routed in a criss-cross fashion. This makes Input Shaping a breeze, as it aligns the X and Y belt tensions (belt shaping) and resonance (input shaping) almost perfectly.

Using Krakens from Omranello https://github.com/D3vil-Design/Kraken-Stepper makes it sense to apply a criss-cross belt tension pattern to the standard rear motor drive system that only utilizes 2x stepper motors.

The front left tensioner is flipped to mirror the stock (OEM) right tensioner, and vice versa for the other.

Check the image below for belt tensioning details.
