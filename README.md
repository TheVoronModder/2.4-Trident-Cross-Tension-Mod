## What is this crazy mod pack?

Simple, I noticed with AWD systems the belt routing is in a Criss / Cross fashion, with that being said, Input Shaping has never been easier to achieve almost identical X Y belt relationships in terms of tensioning (belt shaping) and resonance (input shaping)

with that in mind, using Krakens from Omranello [website] https://github.com/D3vil-Design/Kraken-Stepper

it makes logical sense to me to incorporate criss cross belt tension pattern.

the front left tensioner is flipped to mirror the stock (oem) right mount and visa versa for the other.

See the image below for belt tensioning
